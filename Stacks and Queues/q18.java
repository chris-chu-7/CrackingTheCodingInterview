		//1. Generate a very large array of size that is a multiple of three. Let's
		//say the size of the array is 300.
		
		//The indices would be 0, 99, and 199 in this instance. Let's say we add part to a stack
		//you pick which stack based on which indices to start in, and then to add, just push to the next index
		//and update the top pointer. To delete, select a list, then pull the top pointer -1.
		//to peek, find the index of the pointer stored at the program then update the pointer.
